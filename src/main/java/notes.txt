A Program to demonstrate how to configure the multiple interceptors to single URL:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ActionHandlerController.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor1.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor2.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor3.java
Notes:
* To configure multiple Interceptors, the InterceptorRegistry class given one method.
* public InterceptorRegistration addInterceptor(HandlerInterceptor interceptor) method to add custom interceptor.
* If we not configure any order then interceptors are executed based on their adding order.
